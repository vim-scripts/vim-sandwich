INTRODUCTION				*operator-sandwich-introduction*

*operator-sandwich* is an operator plugin to edit sandwiched textobjects, like
(foo) or "bar". It consists of three independent operators,
|<Plug>(operator-sandwich-add)|, |<Plug>(operator-sandwich-delete)|, and
|<Plug>(operator-sandwich-replace)|.

|<Plug>(operator-sandwich-add)| is an operator to add surroundings to a
textobject. This keymapping is mapped to `sa` in default. For example, assume
that the cursor is on the foo in a text:
>
	foo
<
press `saiw"`, then you will get the following.
>
	"foo"
<
Or if you press `saiw(`, then you will get the following.
>
	(foo)
<
As for the case of '(' and ')', they are registered as a set of surroundings.
That's why the word is appropriately surrounded, otherwise this operator puts
same characters to the both ends like the case of '"'. The registered set of
surroundings are called "recipe", it is described in detail at
|operator-sandwich-configuration|.

|<Plug>(operator-sandwich-delete)| is an operator to delete surroundings to a
textobject. This keymapping is not mapped to any key in normal mode, if you
want to try please assign it to your preferable key. This operator delete
surroundings if the texts at the both ends of selected region are registered
in recipes or are just same characters. For example, assume that it is mapped
to `sd` and the cursor is on the (foo) in a text:
>
	(foo)
<
press `sda(` deletes the parenthesis since the default textobject |a(| assigns
the region surrounded by "(" and ")" including them.
>
	foo
<
It works for "foo" as same with the keypress sd2i" (|iquote|). In practice,
however, |<Plug>(operator-sandwich-delete)| is not assigned to `sd` in normal
mode. Because this operator works well with |textobj-sandwich| which is
implemented to search and select a regions surrounded. Therefore, `sd` is
mapped to the key combination with the textobject in advance. See
|sandwich-keymappings|.

|<Plug>(operator-sandwich-replace)| is an operator to replace surroundings to
a textobject. This keymapping is not mapped to any key in normal mode, if you
want to try please assign it to your preferable key. This operator replace
surroundings if the texts at the both ends of selected region are registered
in recipes or are just same characters. For example, assume that it is mapped
to `sr` and the cursor is on the (foo) in a text:
>
	(foo)
<
press `sra("`, then the operator replace "(" and ")" to '"'.
>
	"foo"
<
The order is that the deletion, "(" and ")", is the first and then the
addition, '"', comes the next. The deleted and added text is chosen in the
same manner with |<Plug>(operator-sandwich-delete)| and
|<Plug>(operator-sandwich-add)|. In practice, `sr` is used by the default
keymappings in combination with |textobj-sandwich| in the same reason with
`sd`.
See |sandwich-keymappings|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These all operators accepts [count], but its handling is not as usual. As for
the default operators and textobjects, the possible key input should be like
this.

		[count]{operator}[count]{textobject}

For example, 3|d||iw| deletes two words and a intermediate space. There are
two points to tell the count, but they are not distinguished. That is,
`3diw` and `d3iw` is fundamentally the same. If both of two points are used,
the count is their product, `3d2iw` and `2d3iw` is identical to `6diw` or
`d6iw.`

In contrast, as for the case of |operator-sandwich|, these three operators
distinguish the count depending on the point to be told. These operators takes
only the first count for own use and the second count is passed to the
following textobject. For example, `2sa3iw((` surrounds two words and a space
by two set of parenthesis.
>
	foo bar   --->   ((foo bar))
<
When you use |.| for the single repeating, the last count is continue to be
used. If the count is given to |.| command, only the count for the textobject
would be updated.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These operators work also in |blockwise-visual| mode. For example, the
following 3 by 3 region is selected:
>
	foo
	bar
	baz
<
press `sa(`
>
	(foo)
	(bar)
	(baz)
<
If short lines are included, for example, the following 4 by 4 region is
selected:
>
	a
	bb
	ccc
	dddd
<
press `sa(`
>
	(a)
	(bb)
	(ccc)
	(dddd)
<
All the lines are processed until the ends of these lines. If a last line is
not the longest line, use |$| command in |blockwise-visual| mode. It extends
the selection until the each end of lines.
>
	aaaa
	bbb
	cc
	d
<
Start from a in the first line, press `<C-v>3j$sa(`, then you will get:
>
	(aaaa)
	(bbb)
	(cc)
	(d)
<

KEYMAPPINGS				*operator-sandwich-keymappings*

This plugin prepares following keymappings. |<Plug>(operator-sandwich-add)|,
|<Plug>(operator-sandwich-delete)| and |<Plug>(operator-sandwich-replace)| are
valid in normal and visual mode in principle. |<Plug>(operator-sandwich-add)|
is mapped to the keysequences `sa` in default, while
|<Plug>(operator-sandwich-delete)| and |<Plug>(operator-sandwich-replace)| are
mappded to the key sequences `sd` and `sr` respectively only in visual mode.
`sd` and `sr` are used by the compound mappings with |textobj-sandwich| in
normal mode. See |sandwich-keymappings|.

function	keymappings				default keymappings
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
add		<Plug>(operator-sandwich-add)		sa

delete		<Plug>(operator-sandwich-delete)	sd (in visual mode)

replace		<Plug>(operator-sandwich-replace)	sr (in visual mode)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you do not need default keymappings, define a variable named
g:operator_sandwich_no_default_key_mappings in your vimrc.
>
	let g:operator_sandwich_no_default_key_mappings = 1
<
Then default mappings are never applied. And map them again as you like.
>
	nmap ys <Plug>(operator-sandwich-add)
	xmap ys <Plug>(operator-sandwich-add)
<

NOTE: To prevent unintended operation, the following setting is strongly
      recommended to add to your vimrc.
>
	nmap s <Nop>
	xmap s <Nop>
<
      |s| could be easily replaced by |c|l| commands.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
keymappings~
<Plug>(operator-sandwich-add)		*<Plug>(operator-sandwich-add)*
	The operator command to add surroundings to the both end of the
	assigned region. If [count] is given, add surroundings [count] times.

<Plug>(operator-sandwich-delete)	*<Plug>(operator-sandwich-delete)*
	The operator command to delete surroundings at the both end of the
	assigned region. If [count] is given, delete successive sets of
	surroundings [count] times.

<Plug>(operator-sandwich-replace)	*<Plug>(operator-sandwich-replace)*
	The operator command to replace surroundings at the both end of the
	assigned region. If [count] is given, replace successive sets of
	surroundings [count] times.



query-1st series~
				*<Plug>(operator-sandwich-add-query1st)*
<Plug>(operator-sandwich-add-query1st)
	The operator command to add surroundings to the both end of the
	assigned region. If [count] is given, add surroundings [count] times.
	Different from |<Plug>(operator-sandwich-add)|, this keymapping asks
	the addition before {motion/textobject}.
>
	nmap sa <Plug>(operator-sandwich-add-query1st)

	" Press sa(iw
	" foo -> (foo)
<
	NOTE: Use it only in normal mode although user can define it in
	      visual mode by |:xmap|. The order of key sequence is same as the
	      usual keymapping, |<Plug>(operator-sandwich-add)| in visual
	      mode. See also |operator-sandwich-miscellaneous|.

				*<Plug>(operator-sandwich-replace-query1st)*
<Plug>(operator-sandwich-replace-query1st)
	The operator command to replace surroundings at the both end of the
	assigned region. If [count] is given, replace successive sets of
	surroundings [count] times.  Different from
	|<Plug>(operator-sandwich-replace)|, this keymapping asks the addition
	before {motion/textobject}.
>
	nmap sa <Plug>(operator-sandwich-replace-query1st)

	" Press sr(a[
	" [foo] -> (foo)
<
	NOTE: Use it only in normal mode although user can define it in
	      visual mode by |:xmap|. The order of key sequence is same as the
	      usual keymapping, |<Plug>(operator-sandwich-replace)| in visual
	      mode. See also |operator-sandwich-miscellaneous|.



Supplementary keymappings~

There are three supplementary keymappings related to the count treatment. They
may be useful when you define your short-hand keymapping. About the unique
count interpretation of the operators, See |operator-sandwich-introduction|.
Practical examples are in |sandwich-keymappings|.

				*<Plug>(operator-sandwich-synchro-count)*
<Plug>(operator-sandwich-synchro-count)
	The keymapping to pass a same count given to the operator for
	following motions/textobjects.
>
 nmap sd(
 \ <Plug>(operator-sandwich-delete)<Plug>(operator-sandwich-synchro-count)a(
<
	A key sequence `2sd(` is identical to
	`2<Plug>(operator-sandwich-delete)2a(` in this case.



				*<Plug>(operator-sandwich-release-count)*
<Plug>(operator-sandwich-release-count)
	The keymapping that a count pass through the operator for following
	motions/textobjects.
>
 nmap sd(
 \ <Plug>(operator-sandwich-delete)<Plug>(operator-sandwich-release-count)a(
<
	A key sequence `2sd(` is identical to
	`<Plug>(operator-sandwich-delete)2a(` in this case.



				*<Plug>(operator-sandwich-squash-count)*
<Plug>(operator-sandwich-squash-count)
	The keymapping that ignores a given count completely.
>
 nmap sd(
 \ <Plug>(operator-sandwich-delete)<Plug>(operator-sandwich-squash-count)a(
<
	A key sequence `2sd(` is identical to
	`<Plug>(operator-sandwich-delete)a(` in this case.



There are two supplementary keymappings to make dot repeating more convenient.
These keymappings relates to a local option, "cursor". There are the choice
"keep" of "cursor" option to keep cursor position after an operator action.
This feature is not valid with dot repeating in default. However if you really
need, these keymappings realize it. Note that it is possible to conflict with
other plugins, please use either one which is appropriate for your
environment. See a topic of a local option "cursor" in
|operator-sandwich-configuration|.

				*<Plug>(operator-sandwich-predot)*
<Plug>(operator-sandwich-predot)
	The keymapping activates the choice "keep" of the "cursor" option with
	dot repeating. This keymapping itself does not send key sequence of
	|.|. Map this key ahead of |.| key sequence. If you are using other
	plugins which make keymapping to |.| key, use this keymapping. For
	example, if you are using repeat.vim (vimscript #2136), use this
	keymapping. Add the following line into your vimrc.
>
	nmap . <Plug>(operator-sandwich-predot)<Plug>(RepeatDot)
<

				*<Plug>(operator-sandwich-dot)*
<Plug>(operator-sandwich-dot)
	The keymapping activates the choice "keep" of the "cursor" option with
	dot repeating. This keymapping itself sends key sequence of |.|. If
	you are not using any other plugin which makes keymapping to |.| key,
	use this keymapping. Add the following line into your vimrc.
>
	nmap . <Plug>(operator-sandwich-dot)
<



KEY MAPPING FUNCTIONS~

User can make new mappings by using function interfaces natively.

					*operator#sandwich#keymap()*
operator#sandwich#keymap(kind, mode[, options[, recipes]])
	This function is used to make a operator key-mapping as following.
>
	nnoremap <silent> sa :<C-u>call operator#sandwich#keymap('add', 'n')<CR>
	xnoremap <silent> sa <Esc>:call operator#sandwich#keymap('add', 'x')<CR>
<
	If a not-empty dictionary is given to the optional third argument of
	this function, the local options inside the dictionary override
	default option values. However, it can not be assigned to motionwises
	separately.
>
	" example 1
	nnoremap <silent> sa
	\ <Esc>:call operator#sandwich#keymap(
	\ 'add',
	\ 'n',
	\ {'highlight': 0}
	\ )<CR>

	" example 2
	let g:sandwich_alt_options = {'highlight': 0}
	nnoremap <silent> sa
	\ <Esc>:call operator#sandwich#keymap(
	\ 'add',
	\ 'n',
	\ g:sandwich_alt_options
	\ )<CR>
<

	If a not-empty list of recipes is given to the optional fourth
	argument of this function, the key mapping use the list instead of
	|sandwich#recipes| (or |sandwich#default_recipes|) and
	|operator#sandwich#recipes| (or |operator#sandwich#default_recipes|).
>
	" example 1
	nnoremap <silent> sa
	\ <Esc>:call operator#sandwich#keymap(
	\ 'add',
	\ 'n',
	\ {},
	\ [{'buns': ['(', ')']}]
	\ )<CR>

	" example 2
	let g:sandwich_alt_recipes = [{'buns': ['(', ')']}]
	nnoremap <silent> sa
	\ <Esc>:call operator#sandwich#keymap(
	\ 'add',
	\ 'n',
	\ {},
	\ g:sandwich_alt_recipes
	\ )<CR>
<



					*operator#sandwich#query1st()*
operator#sandwich#query1st(kind, mode[, options[, recipes]])
	This function is similar as |operator#sandwich#keymap()|, but it is
	used for declaring new query1st series key mappings,
	|<Plug>(operator-sandwich-add-query1st)| and
	|<Plug>(operator-sandwich-replace-query1st)|.



==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION				*operator-sandwich-configuration*

A set of surroundings and options for it is called "recipe". Each recipe is a
dictionary and the |list|s of recipes determines the operator's behavior.
|g:sandwich#default_recipes| is one of the |list|s of recipes. This is shared
to be used with |textobj-sandwich| since it is convenient in many cases. If
|g:sandwich#recipes| is defined by user, it is employed alternatively. The
default recipes |g:sandwich#default_recipes| can be checked by |:echo|
command.
>
	:echo g:sandwich#default_recipes
<
This variable is locked usually, but it can be copied when you declare
|g:sandwich#recipes| if you need.
>
	:let g:sandwich#recipes = deepcopy(g:sandwich#default_recipes)
<
The set of (), [], {}, <> are registered in default. The detailed description
is in |g:sandwich#default_recipes|.

|g:operator#sandwich#default_recipes| is another list of recipes. This is used
only by |operator-sandwich|. If |g:operator#sandwich#recipes| is defined, it
is employed alternatively. |g:operator#sandwich#default_recipes| is locked as
same as |g:sandwich#default_recipes|.



g:operator#sandwich#recipes		*g:operator#sandwich#recipes*
	This is one of the lists of recipes which is referred only from
	|operator-sandwich|.  If this list does not exist,
	|g:operator#sandwich#default_recipes| is used.



g:operator#sandwich#default_recipes	*g:operator#sandwich#default_recipes*
	This is one of the lists of recipes which is prepared in default. If
	|g:operator#sandwich#recipes| exists, it will be used alternatively.
	This variable is locked usually, but it can be copied when you declare
	|g:operator#sandwich#recipes| if you need.
>
	:let g:operator#sandwich#recipes
	 \ = deepcopy(g:operator#sandwich#default_recipes)
<



NOTE: If recipes are conflicted in some reason,
      |g:operator#sandwich#default_recipes| and |g:operator#sandwich#recipes|
      is prior to |g:sandwich#default_recipes| and |g:sandwich#recipes|. In a
      same list, a latter item is prior to a former item.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A recipe is a |Dictionary| variable and it can have four kinds of information.
Requisite, input, filters and local options. The requisite is essential for
all recipe, it defines a set of surroundings. The input is a option to assign
a recipe for an action. The filters is the option to filter recipes depending
on the situation in use. The local option is utilized to tune the behavior for
each recipe. In addition to them, several global options are employed to
control fundamental behavior of the operators.

As a first step, define your list of recipes.
>
	let g:sandwich#recipes = []
<
Or just copy the default one if you need.
>
	let g:sandwich#recipes = deepcopy(g:sandwich#default_recipes)
<

Requisite~
There are two kinds of requisite, buns and external. All recipes should have
any one of the two.

buns
	This is the key to assign the surroundings. Its value is a list
	including two strings. These are used for additions in add/replace
	operators, and are searched as deletions in delete/replace operators.
	If "regex" option is true, it is regarded as regular expression. If a
	recipe do not have "input" option, this is used as the assignment
	input.
>
	let g:sandwich#recipes += [
	  \    {'buns': ['(', ')']}
	  \  ]

	" Press saiw( or saiw)
	"       foo   --->   (foo)

	let g:sandwich#recipes += [
	  \    {'buns': ['ab', 'cd']}
	  \  ]

	" Press saiwab or saiwcd
	"       foo   --->   abfoocd

	let g:sandwich#recipes += [
	  \    {'buns': ['ab', 'cd'], 'input': ['a']}
	  \  ]

	" Press saiwa
	"       foo   --->   abfoocd
<



external
	This is a supplementary requisite. This is a list including two
	textobjects as strings. This is used only for determining deletions in
	delete/replace operators. In other words, they can not be a candidate
	of additions. The deletions are determined as the differences of the
	textobjects. A narrower textobject is the first item and wider
	textobject is the second item. Many local options are not valid.
>
	let g:sandwich#recipes += [
	  \    {'external': ['it', 'at']}
	  \  ]

	" "it" selects the text inside tags, "at" selects including tags.
	" Therefore, the deletions are the both tags.
	"              <---it--->
	"       <title>title here</title>
	"       <----------at----------->

	" Press <Plug>(operator-sandwich-delete)at
	"       <title>title here</title>   --->   title here
<
	"noremap" option is applied for this. Since visual selection is
	employed to check its region intrinsically, mappings in visual mode
	are related to the action.
>
	let g:sandwich#recipes += [
	  \    {'external': ['i[', 'a['], 'noremap': 0}
	  \  ]

	" Press <Plug>(operator-sandwich-delete)a[
	"       [foo]   --->   foo

	xnoremap i[ i{
	xnoremap a[ a{

	" Press <Plug>(operator-sandwich-delete)a{
	"       {foo}   --->   foo
<
	Combined with "noremap" option, user defined textobjects can be used
	in the same way.
>
	" "noremap" option should be false.
	let g:sandwich#recipes += [
	  \    {
	  \      'external': ["\<Plug>(textobj-sandwich-auto-i)",
	  \                   "\<Plug>(textobj-sandwich-auto-a)"],
	  \      'noremap': 0,
	  \    }
	  \ ]
<
	NOTE: Registered textobjects should work correctly in visual mode.
	NOTE: Not all the user defined textobjects are guaranteed to work.



Input~

input
	This is the key to assign a recipe for an action. The operators ask
	user to determine addition in an action. At that moment, users are
	asked an input to assign a recipe. This option makes the input. If a
	recipe does not have the key, items in "buns" are used for the
	assignment.
>
	let g:sandwich#recipes += [
	  \    {'buns': ['"""', '"""']}
	  \  ]
	" Press saiw"""
	" foo   --->   """foo"""
<
	If the recipe has input key, it will be used alternatively.
>
	let g:sandwich#recipes += [
	  \    {'buns': ['"""', '"""'], 'input': ['"']}
	  \  ]
	" Press saiw"
	" foo   --->   """foo"""
<
	This value should be a |list|, and multiple assignment is valid.



Filter~

filetype
	This filter filters recipes by filetypes in use. It is a list of
	filetypes as strings. If a recipe does not have filetype key or has a
	value "all", the recipe is valid on any filetype.
>
	" The following recipes are valid on any filetype.
	let g:sandwich#recipes += [
	  \    {'buns': ['(', ')']}
	  \    {'buns': ['[', ']'], 'filetype': ['all']}
	  \  ]

	" The textobj "it" and "at" is not versatile and might be heavy on
	" large files, thus it would be better to activate only on specific
	" filetypes.
	let g:sandwich#recipes += [
	  \    {'external': ['it', 'at'], 'filetype': ['html']}
	  \  ]
<



kind
	This filter filters recipes by kinds of operator actions. It is a list
	of names of kinds. "add", "delete", "replace", "operator" and "all"
	can be used. "operator" is same as that "add", "delete" and "replace"
	is specified. The difference between "operator" and "all" is that
	"all" might include textobject kind in |g:sandwich#recipes|. See
	|textobj-sandwich-configuration|. If a recipe does not have kind key,
	the recipe is valid on any kind.
>
	" The following recipe is valid only with the add operator.
	let g:sandwich#recipes += [
	  \    {'buns': ['"""', '"""'], 'kind': ['add']}
	  \  ]
<



motionwise
	This filter filters recipes by motionwise (visualmode in visual mode).
	It is a list of motionwises. "char", "line", "block" and "all" can be
	used. See |characterwise|, |linewise|, |characterwise-visual|,
	|linewise-visual|, |blockwise-visual|. If a recipe does not have
	motionwise key, the recipe is valid on any motionwise.
>
	" The following recipe is valid only in linewise motion or linewise
	" visual.
	let g:sandwich#recipes += [
	  \    {'buns': ['```', '```'], 'motionwise': ['line']}
	  \  ]
<



mode
	This filter filters recipes by modes. It is a list of characters
	representing modes. "n" or "x" can be used. "n" represents a use in
	normal mode, and "x" represents a use in visual mode. If a recipe does
	not have mode key, the recipe is valid on any mode.
>
	" These recipes are switch behaviors on modes with the same input.
	let g:sandwich#recipes += [
	  \    {'buns': ['"', '"'], 'mode': ['n']}
	  \    {'buns': ['"""', '"""'], 'mode': ['x'], 'input': ['"']}
	  \  ]
<



action
	This filter filters recipes by kinds of action. In principle, all the
	operator's action could be split into two kinds, "add" and "delete".
	The add operator has "add" action and the delete operator has "delete"
	action. The replace operator has both "delete" action phase and "add"
	action phase to replace strings. This filter limits the chance to be
	used in each action. Available item is "add", "delete" and "all". If a
	recipe does not have action key, the recipe is valid in both actions.
>
	" The recipe is valid only in add actions
	let g:sandwich#recipes += [
	  \    {'buns': ['"""', '"""'], 'action': ['add'], 'input': ['"']}
	  \  ]
<



expr_filter
	A user can define filters by oneself. The items of the list is
	evaluated as |expressions|, and if the value is true (1) then the
	recipe is valid, if the value is false (0) then the recipe is invalid.
>
	" A filter should be defined in somewhere, for example in your vimrc.
	function! FilterValid()
	    return 1
	endfunction

	function! FilterInvalid()
	    return 0
	endfunction

	" This recipe is valid
	let g:sandwich#recipes += [
	  \    {'buns': ['(', ')'], 'expr_filter': ['FilterValid()']}
	  \  ]

Local option~

Local options are used to optimize the behavior for each recipe. If any
option is set, the default value depending on kinds and motionwises is used.
These default values are changed by |g:operator#sandwich#options|.

If you want to change the default value of highlight option of add action in
character-wise motion:
>
	let g:operator#sandwich#options.add.char.highlight = 0
<
Or use the function |operator#sandwich#set()|.
>
	call operator#sandwich#set('add', 'char', 'highlight', 0)
<



g:operator#sandwich#options		*g:operator#sandwich#options*
	The dictionary includes default local option values.
>
	let operator#sandwich#options[kind][motionwise][option] = {value}

	" For example
	let g:operator#sandwich#options['add']['char']['highlight'] = 0
	" or
	let g:operator#sandwich#options.add.char.highlight = 0
<
	Available keys are listed below.
	  * kind

					*operator#sandwich#set()*
operator#sandwich#set(kind, motionwise, option, value)
	The function to change default values of local options easily and
	safely. If the combination of arguments is not appropriate, this
	function shows error messages. The available arguments are listed in
	|g:operator#sandwich#options|. In addition to that, "all" is available
	for kind and motionwise.



operator#sandwich#set_default()		*operator#sandwich#set_default()*
	The function initializes all default values of local options.



cursor
	This is a local option which determines the cursor position after
	an action. "inner_head", "keep", "inner_tail", "head" and "tail" can
	be used.
	  inner_head: the head of a surrounded text
	  keep      : the same position at start
	  inner_tail: the tail of a surrounded text
	  head      : the head of the former surrounding
	  tail      : the tail of the latter surrounding

<
	NOTE: Unfortunately, "keep" option cannot be used in |.| command
	      in default. In that case automatically falls back to
	      "inner_head" option. If needed, use a supplementary keymapping,
	      |<Plug>(operator-sandwich-predot)| or
	      |<Plug>(operator-sandwich-dot)|.

highlight
	This option switch the highlight feature. If the value is true, the
	both ends of a assigned region are highlighted in add operator. In
	delete/replace operators, the both deleted regions are highlighted.
	As for the delete operator, both deleted regions are highlighted in a
	short time, see |g:operator#sandwich#highlight_duration|, after
	determined the following motions/textobjects. If a user press any key
	in the time, the operator immediately quit the highlighting.

	The highlight color can be changed by the |highlight-groups| named
	OperatorSandwichBuns (|hl-OperatorSandwichBuns|). It is linked to a
	default |highlight-groups| IncSearch (|hl-IncSearch|).

	    - block: 1
	  * replace
	    - char : 1
	    - line : 1
	    - block: 1



skip_space
	This option enables to skip spaces at both ends of a assigned region.
	If the value is 1, adjust the both ends to skip white spaces.
>
	let g:sandwich#recipes += [
	  \   {'buns': ['(', ')'], 'skip_space': 0}

	  \   {'buns': ['(', ')'], 'skip_space': 1}
	  \ ]
	"   ?foo?   --->  ?(foo)?  : ? is space
<
	However as for the case of delete/replace operators if both ends are
	white spaces then it fills up the working condition for operators and
	white spaces would be deleted/replaced. Thus this option just works
	when either one end of the assigned region is white space.

	  \   {'buns': ['"', '"'], 'skip_space': 1}
	  \ ]
	" Press sda"
	"   ?"foo"   --->  ?foo    : ? is space
<
	If the value is 2, adjust the both ends to skip white spaces even
	though the both ends are white spaces.

	Default values
	  * add
	    - char : 0
	    - line : 1

noremap
	This option switches the behavior when adding buns (surroundings) to
	the both ends whether the key presses are remapped to the nested
	mappings. If the value is true then it would not be remapped.
>

linewise
	This option change the way to add/delete surroundings. The usual
	behavior is like character-wise.
>
	call operator#sandwich#set('add', 'char', 'linewise', 0)
	" Press saiw(

	               )
<
	For the case of deleting, if there are nothing other than white spaces
	and breaking after deleting, delete the lines.
>
	call operator#sandwich#set('delete', 'char', 'linewise', 0)
	" Press <Plug>(operator-sandwich-delete)a(

<
	For the case of replace operator, it behaves in the combination of
	additions and deletions.

	NOTE: In |cmdline-window|, this option is ignored and behave as if it
	      was 0.

	Default values
	  * add
	    - char : 0
	    - line : 1
	    - block: 0
	  * delete
	    - char : 0

command
	This is a list of commands which is executed after an action. After an
	action, the marks |'[| and |']| would be set at the head and the tail
	of the modified region in each action.
>

	  * replace
	    - char : []
	    - line : []
	    - block: []



query_once
	This option switches the behavior when a [count] is given. If this
	option is false, add/replace operators ask additions [count] times.
	Whereas if this option is true, add/replace operators ask only once
	and add it [count] times.

	Default values
	  * add
	    - char : 0
	    - line : 0
	    - block: 0
	  * replace
	    - char : 0
	    - line : 0
	    - block: 0



expr
	If this option is 1 or 2, requisite "buns" is evaluated as expression.
	If this option is 1, "buns" are evaluated once and repeat it by |.|
	command. If this option is 2, "buns" are evaluated every times in |.|
	repeating. If you want to match deleted/replaced surroundings by
	expressions, use "synchro" option of |textobj-sandwich| together. For
	example, the following recipe adds the text in the unnamed register.
	(ref. |let-@|, |quotequote|)
>
	let g:sandwich#recipes += [
	  \   {'buns': ['@@', '@@'], 'expr': 1, 'synchro': 1, 'input': ['@']}
	  \ ]
<
	NOTE: If this option is true, the recipe requires "input" to call by
	      key inputs. "buns" never be regarded as key inputs to trigger.

	NOTE: If the expressions query user something by |getchar()| or
	      |input()|, the recipe may cause problems on the
	      |operator-sandwich| delete operator and |textobj-sandwich|
	      textobjects, |<Plug>(textobj-sandwich-auto-i)| and
	      |<Plug>(textobj-sandwich-auto-a)|. To avoid this problem, it is
	      reccomended to set "kind" and "action" filters. For example the
	      following recipe query to get a tag name and surround by html
	      style tags.

	NOTE: Different from |textobj-sandwich|, |operator-sandwich| allows
	      empty string as bun. If you want to cancel the operation,
	      |:throw| an exception 'OperatorSandwichCancel'.

<
	If the item is |Funcref|, it should be possible to accept an argument.
>
	:function {func}(is_head, ...)
<
	If a:is_head is 1, the function is required to return head
	surrounding. If a:is_head is 0, the function is required to return
	tail surrounding. Not necessarily to use the argument, use if needed.
	In future, the arguments are possible to append. Thus it might be
	better to assign variable-length argument.

	Default values
	  * add
	    - char : 0
	    - line : 0
	    - block: 0
	  * replace
	    - char : 0
	    - line : 0
	    - block: 0



autoindent
	This option is used in order to control vim autoindent feature in an
	operator action. The value is an integer and the numbers from 1 to 3
	correspond to vim built-in options 'autoindent', 'smartindent' and
	'cindent' respectively. If the value is 0, then never use autoindent
	function. If the value is negative integer, then it does not change
	any setting, just use the current autoindent setting. In case you
	want to use 'indentexpr' option, the value would be a negative
	integer.

	  * -n : Current settings (if it is not empty, then 'indentexpr')
	  *  0 : 'noautoindent', 'nosmartindent', 'nocindent', 'noindentexpr'
	  *  1 : 'autoindent'
	  *  2 : 'smartindent'
	  *  3 : 'cindent'

	If "buns" include line breaks, it would be better to think about this
	option. Practically the value 1 ('autoindent') would be helpful in
	many cases, at least it is easier to expect its result. The other
	positive integers sometime cause unexpected results, use them with
	care.

	    - block: 1



indentkeys
indentkeys+
indentkeys-
	These options are used in order to change 'indentkeys' or 'cinkeys'
	option temporary in an action. The format is identical to 'cinkeys'.
	The value of "indentkeys" is set as written directly, as if the string
	was assigned to the {value} of |:set| indentkeys={value}. Similar to
	that, "indentkeys+" and "indentkeys-" is set as if they are assigned
	to the {value} of |:set| indentkeys+={value} or
	|:set| indentkeys-={value}. See |:set+=| and |:set-=|. One thing there
	is a difference from |:set-=| is that user does not need to mind about
	the order of items. |:set-=| depends on the order of items.
>
	:set indentkeys?    " -> 0{,0},:,0#,!^F,o,O,e

<
	In contrast to that, user does not need to care about the order of
	items for the local option "indentkeys-". Simply list the items to be
	removed.

<
	If 'indentexpr' is empty and 'cindent' is valid, these options are
	applied to 'cinkeys'.

regex
	If this option is true, requisite "buns" is regarded as regular
	expressions. If this option is true, the recipe is not used for
	adding steps in add/replace operators, is only used for deleting steps
	in delete/replace operators.

Global option~

There are several options to control fundamental behavior of the operators.

g:operator#sandwich#timeoutlen		*g:operator#sandwich#timeoutlen*
	The time in milli seconds that waits for a key code or mapped key
	sequence to complete. If there are recipes overlapped, this option is
	used. Assume that the following recipes are prepared:
>
	let g:sandwich#recipes = [
	  \   {'buns': ['(', ')']}
	  \   {'buns': ['((', '))']}
	  \ ]
<
	after pressing saiw(, the operator waits in the time. If you press one
	more ( in the time, then a recipe for '((' and '))' is decided to use.
	No keypress has come through the time a recipe for '(' and ')' is
	settled. The default value is same as 'timeoutlen' vim option.



				*g:operator#sandwich#highlight_duration*
g:operator#sandwich#highlight_duration
	This option determines the time duration to show deletions in an
	delete operator action. Give number in milli seconds.
	The default value is 200.



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|g:operator#sandwich#default_recipes| has a unique recipe:
>
	  {
	\    'buns': [
	\        'input("operator-sandwich:head: ")',
	\        'input("operator-sandwich:tail: ")'
	\    ],
	\    'kind'  : ['add', 'replace'],
	\    'action': ['add']
	\    'expr'  : 1,
	\    'input' : ['i']
	\ },
<
The meanings of these options are explained already. The important thing is
that this recipe can be called by f key press and realizes the instant
definition of recipe. This recipe is used like this. First call this recipe,
for example, press `saiwi` on bar.
>
	bar
<
Then the cursor is moved to command line area and prompts to input a addition
to the head. For example, assume that foo is input and pressed enter key.
>
	operator-sandwich:head: foo
<
Next you would be prompted to input a addition to the tail. For example,
assume that baz is input and pressed enter key.
>
	operator-sandwich:tail: baz
<
Finally you will get foobarbaz.
>
	foobarbaz
<
You may think there are too many steps, but it can be repeated by |.| command.
If you take into account the fact, it might be able to find the case it is
useful.



==============================================================================
HIGHLIGHT GROUP				*operator-sandwich-highlight-group*

All the three operators have highlighting feature. On and off is controlled by
the local option "highlight", but the coloring is defined by its highlight
group.

OperatorSandwichBuns			*hl-OperatorSandwichBuns*
	The highlight group to declare the highlight feature of the operators.
	It is linked to a default highlight group IncSearch |hl-IncSearch| in
	default.
>
	highlight link OperatorSandwichBuns IncSearch
<
	Users can define their preferable coloring.
>
	highlight OperatorSandwichBuns ctermfg=White ctermbg=Red
	                             \ guifg=White   guibg=Red
<



==============================================================================
AUTOCOMMAND				*operator-sandwich-autocommand*

Users can hook some processes for the start and the end of the operator action
by |:autocmd| command. Each operator defines its own |User| autocommand
events, users just declare autocommands if needed.

add operator~
OperatorSandwichAddPre			*OperatorSandwichAddPre*
	The autocommand event ignited right before the add operator action.

OperatorSandwichAddPost			*OperatorSandwichAddPost*
	The autocommand event ignited right after the add operator action.

delete operator~
OperatorSandwichDeletePre		*OperatorSandwichDeletePre*
	The autocommand event ignited right before the delete operator action.

OperatorSandwichDeletePost		*OperatorSandwichDeletePost*
	The autocommand event ignited right after the delete operator action.

replace operator~
OperatorSandwichReplacePre		*OperatorSandwichReplacePre*
	The autocommand event ignited right before the replace operator
	action.

OperatorSandwichReplacePost		*OperatorSandwichReplacePost*
	The autocommand event ignited right after the replace operator action.

Example~
The following example disables matchit.vim (default plugin) highlighting in
add/replace operators action.
>
 autocmd User OperatorSandwichAddPre,OperatorSandwichReplacePre NoMatchParen
 autocmd User OperatorSandwichAddPost,OperatorSandwichReplacePost DoMatchParen
<



==============================================================================

Highlighting in the delete operator is really irritating.~
	Yes, you are right. Add the line to your vimrc.
>
	call operator#sandwich#set('delete', 'all', 'highlight', 0)
<



Highlighting is always irritating.~
	Ah, you might be right. Add the line to your vimrc.
>
	call operator#sandwich#set('all', 'all', 'highlight', 0)
<



Highlighting by matchit.vim is confusing.~
	Use |:autocmd| to disable it temporary.
	See |operator-sandwich-autocommands|.
>
 autocmd User OperatorSandwichAddPre,OperatorSandwichReplacePre NoMatchParen
 autocmd User OperatorSandwichAddPost,OperatorSandwichReplacePost DoMatchParen
<
	Or just use a clearly different coloring depending on your favorite
	colorscheme. See |operator-sandwich-highlight-group|.
>
	highlight OperatorSandwichBuns ctermfg=White ctermbg=Red
	                             \ guifg=White   guibg=Red

Why does not the add operator skip white spaces in character-wise motion?~
	Because it sometimes causes unwanted results when I use visual mode
	selection. That is, I sometimes want to surround a text including
	space. If you don't like it, add the line to your vimrc.
>
	call operator#sandwich#set('add', 'char', 'skip_space', 1)
<



Why the default mappings for the delete/replace operators were not defined?~
	Because of their characteristics, it is better to use always with
	|textobj-sandwich|. Thus, compound mappings are defined alternatively.
	See |sandwich-keymappings|. In visual mode, you can use as same as
	other operators.
	However, of course, these operators |<Plug>(operator-sandwich-delete)|
	and |<Plug>(operator-sandwich-replace)| can work with any
	motions/textobjects as far as matching their working condition. If you
	are interested, please map them somewhere you want and try!



I want to keep cursor position even after dot repeating.~
	The item "keep" of the local option "cursor" is not valid with dot
	repeating in default. However, if necessary, using either
	|<Plug>(operator-sandwich-predot)| or |<Plug>(operator-sandwich-dot)|,
	it can enable the feature. If you are using other plugins which make
	keymappings to |.| key, use |<Plug>(operator-sandwich-predot)|. For
	example, if you are using repeat.vim (vimscript #2136), add the
	following line into your vimrc.
>
	nmap . <Plug>(operator-sandwich-predot)<Plug>(RepeatDot)
<
	Otherwise use |<Plug>(operator-sandwich-dot)|.
>
	nmap . <Plug>(operator-sandwich-dot)
<
	See each detailed description of |<Plug>(operator-sandwich-predot)|
	and |<Plug>(operator-sandwich-dot)|.



What is special about the query1st series mappings?~
	There are two query1st series keymappings,
	|<Plug>(operator-sandwich-add-query1st)| and
	|<Plug>(operator-sandwich-replace-query1st)|. These are different from
	usual |<Plug>(operator-sandwich-add)| and
	|<Plug>(operator-sandwich-replace)| on the order of key sequences in
	normal mode. As for the usual keymappings, the assignment of
	{addition} is input at last.
>
	{operator}{motion/textobject}{addition}
<
	For instance, if user wants to surround a word by (), press `saiw(`.
	In this case, `sa` is {operator}, `iw` is {textobject}, `(` is the
	assignment of {addition}.

	As for the query1st series mappings, on the other hand, {addition}
	comes ahead of {textobject}.
>
	{operator}{addition}{motion/textobj}
<
	That is, the equivalent key sequence of the above instance is `sa(iw`.
	These keymappings would be useful to define solid shortened mappings.
>
	nmap s( <Plug>(operator-sandwich-add-query1st)(
	nmap s[ <Plug>(operator-sandwich-add-query1st)[
	nmap s{ <Plug>(operator-sandwich-add-query1st){

	" Press s(iw
	" foo -> (foo)
<
	Query1st series keymappings have a few limitation since determining
	{addition} before {motion} or {textobject} which assigns the processed
	region.

	1. "motionwise" filter dropped recipes other than the recipes which is
	   valid for all kinds of region (char, line, block) regardless of the
	   actual assigned region.
	2. "highlight" local option is ignored. Never be highlighted.
	3. "query_once" local option is set to 1 because the above use case is
	   mainly assumed. However this could be overwritten by using
	   |operator#sandwich#query1st()| function to re-define keymapping.
>
	nmap <silent> <Plug>(operator-sandwich-add-query1st)
	  \ operator#sandwich#query1st('add', 'n', {'query_once': 0})<CR>

	nmap ssa <Plug>(operator-sandwich-add-query1st)
<
	In visual mode, there is nothing different on the order of key
	sequences. Rather there are a few limitations listed, thus it is
	recommended to use usual key mappings.
>
	xmap s( <Plug>(operator-sandwich-add)(
	xmap s[ <Plug>(operator-sandwich-add)[
	xmap s{ <Plug>(operator-sandwich-add){
<


There is conflict with auto-complete plugins.~
	Because |operator-sandwich| inserts text as if user typed, some
	auto-complete plugins could interrupt. If in that case, use
	autocommand to disable them temporary.
